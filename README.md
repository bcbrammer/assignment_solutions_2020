# assignment_solutions_2020
solutions to selected assignments from my first year studying computer science

These do not reflect my current skill level!!!
Just to show progression, and to look back on later.

Many of them were coded strangely to conform to assignment requirements, also.

In chronological order:

- Dates_M02_HW_P1 (formats dates, initial data cleaning)
- Computer_cpp (builds a computer, sort of. first big class and exception handler. this is VERY messy because of requirements and my knowledge at the time)
- SimpleCaesarCipher (exactly what it says)
- wordExtraction (pulls words out of a .txt file, precise text data cleaning and comparison)
- NerfGun (simple, streamlined class that lets you shoot 5 nerf guns)

A lot of these include a class called DataValidator - this is probably the only thing I am
actually proud of in these programs at this point in my more advanced knowledge.
I developed it as I went through Computer Science I & II so that I could clean my user's console input.
I will probably post the final version of it eventually.
